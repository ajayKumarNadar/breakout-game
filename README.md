Hey there 🙋‍♂️

I have recreated the Breakout game from the 80s.

you can check it out either running the .exe file locally.                    
<strong>Note:</strong> keep the "main.exe", "ball.py", paddle.py" and "tiles.py" in the same folder if you are running the .exe file, else it wont work.

OR,
You can run the game in replit-

<h4>Gameplay:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>First click "spacebar" to start the game.
    <li>Left-click & Hold on the paddle and move your mouse to move the paddle.
    <li>Destroy all the tiles to WIN.
    <li>Destroy all the lives to LOSE.
<ul>
