Hey there 🙋‍♂️

I have recreated the Breakout game from the 80s.

you can check it out either running the .exe file locally.                    
<strong>Note:</strong> keep the "main.exe", "ball.py", paddle.py" and "tiles.py" in the same folder if you are running the .exe file, else it wont work.

OR,
You can run the game in replit-
